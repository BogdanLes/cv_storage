# cv_storage
The scope of the project is to store information about the companies i've sent CVs to.

The website has 2 pages:
1. main: can search/add new CVs
- can add new coutries for companies 
- lists latest companies that i've sent CVs to
2. browse: can display companies acording to country and dates i've sent CVs, as well as sort them

I've also tested:
- simplexml
- classes (inheritance, static methods, constructor ...)
- iterator
- lambdas
- AJAX and JSON
